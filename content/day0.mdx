a unique phase for building a habit.
From consistently exercising to casually learning how to make brownies, I realized that building habits often feels
unexciting—boring, even. Flat. But that’s only in the beginning, right?

at first, it feels impossible. Then, it becomes a necessity. Slowly, it turns into something manageable. Eventually, it becomes
second nature—a habit.

but what if we start building habits in a more engaging way? And what exactly is #30DWC?

#30DWC stands for the 30 Days Writing Challenge—just as mentioned in the title. It is a social campaign by Passion Writing
Academy aimed at developing a creative and practical writing habit. i stumbled upon it while scrolling through Twitter,
and without hesitation, i immediately wanted to give it a try.

So, I’ve decided to commit to writing for the next 30 days. each day comes with a different prompt—30 questions revolving around
self-exploration and life. It’s a mindful analysis method, I think. First, we’ll describe our current situation. Then, we’ll dive
deeper into self-reflection—understanding who we are and where we come from.

By answering these questions and gaining knowledge about ourselves, we can begin exploring possibilities. The ultimate goal is
to build a genuine and honest connection with ourselves—expressing it through writing.
